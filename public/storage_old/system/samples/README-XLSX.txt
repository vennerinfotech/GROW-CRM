NOTE: To create the import-items.xlsx file:

1. Open import-items.csv in Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets
2. Save As -> Excel Workbook (.xlsx format)
3. Save as "import-items.xlsx" in this directory

The CSV file contains the same data and can be used directly for importing.
Both CSV and XLSX formats are supported by the import feature.
